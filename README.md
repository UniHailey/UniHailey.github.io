        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Warm your stock. Measure, chop, and gather all of the ingredients going into your risotto. You should also warm the broth in a saucepan over low heat, which helps the risotto come together faster. If you need to skip heating the broth, make sure it’s at least at room temperature and not cold from the fridge.
</p>
<p><strong>step 2:</strong>Sweat the shallot. Melt a tablespoon of butter over medium heat in a 10- or 12-inch straight-sided saute pan. Add the shallot and a pinch of salt and cook the shallot, stirring often, until fragrant and beginning to soften, about 4 minutes. </p>
<p><strong>step 3:</strong>Toast the rice. Pour the rice over the onions and stir until every grain is coated with the butter. Add more fat if needed — this is not the time to skimp! Continue stirring the rice until the edges have turned translucent but the center is still opaque, about 2 minutes. You should also be able to smell the aroma of toasted rice. Avoid actually browning the rice here; toasting the rice is all about the aroma. </P>
<p><strong>step 4:</strong>Deglaze the pan with wine. Deglazing the pan at this point isn't strictly necessary, but a splash of white wine will add another layer of flavor and help lift up any bits that have caramelized to the pan. Use a 1/2 cup of wine, and simmer, stirring constantly, until the wine has completely reduced and the pan is nearly dry, about 3 minutes. </p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong>Slowly add the broth in increments, stirring in between. Begin incrementally adding the broth one 1/2 cup at a time, stirring regularly between additions. Wait to add another ladle until the liquid has been almost completely absorbed by the rice; dragging your spatula through the rice should leave a dry path where the spatula was. This gradual addition of liquid is key to getting the rice to release its starch and create its own delicious sauce, so don't rush this step. Ideally, you want to use just enough broth to cook the rice and no more.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong>Finishing and serving the risotto. As a final step, add one or two tablespoons of butter and a cup of cheese to enrich the risotto and make it extra-creamy. Serve the risotto immediately. The longer it stands, the more the starches will set and you'll lose the creamy silkiness. </p>

<p><strong>Step2:</strong>Taste and adjust seasonings if desired. Add to salad, toss, and serve.</p>
